                <p>
                    I'm interested in understanding software systems, small and large, and making them faster,
                    safer, and more equitable. I'm currently a student at Miami University, studying
                    Computer Science. I've worked on many projects, from reverse engineering Pixel firmware
                    and exam surveillance software, to wrapping io_uring in Swift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building an n-day exploit for the Pixel 6/6a bootloader</li>
                        <li>Transforming PDFs into more accessible documents and identifying text semantics</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's a summary of the places I've worked and the projects I've done below.
